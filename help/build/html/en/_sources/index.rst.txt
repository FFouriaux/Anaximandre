Documentation for the Anaximandre plugin
============================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2


Introduction
=================
The Anaximandre plugin enables the creation of 3D polygon, line and point shapefiles (.shp) from a points layer in csv format. 
The points must include, in addition to their coordinates, descriptive values which allow them to be grouped, and a code value which defines the geometry to be generated. 
The codes are:

* For a polygon : 'p'
* For a line : 'l'
* For a point : 'pt'
* For linked reference points : 'pt cpe'
* For an isolated artefact : 'iso'
* For a DEM point : 'pt mnt'
* For a circle : 'c', followed by its diameter in meters
* For an ellipse from three points: ‘e’

The order of the points in the file must follow a few rules: 

* The points must follow the outline of the intended line or polygon
* For circles, the center of the circle will be used
* For ellipses, the first point is the center and one point on the major axis and an other on the minor axis
* For DEMs, there is no particular order

The result will be a group of layers containing 3D entities as well as the following attributes: 

* First description (e.g. context number) 
* Second description (e.g. type) 
* Average Z

The dialog box
======================
The plugin requires two initial parameters:
 
* a csv file: **CSV File**

* The location for the output files: **Output**

When a csv file is selected, the data in the first line of the file are shown in order to verify their conformity

The **OK** button launches the program and loads the layers onto the map
